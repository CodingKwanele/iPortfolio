            In this project, I created a number guessing game and focused on refining its appearance and functionality. 
            I delved into CSS styling techniques to enhance the visual design of the game interface. 
            Moreover, I expanded user interaction by enabling input from both button clicks and keyboard strokes. 
            To accomplish these enhancements, I conducted research across various online resources, which allowed me to implement the desired features effectively. 
            This project not only improved my coding abilities but also emphasized my commitment to enhancing user experiences.
